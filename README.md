SINGLE-CELL ANALYSIS OPTIMIZATION TOOL

This program allows the user to find the superceding node for a single or series of input genes 
using scikit-learn, a Python-based, open-source machine learning library. The user is first prompted to 
enter a gene or series of genes into the console. The program reads gene expression data and cell types 
from csv files that are pre-populated with data from the CIBERSORTx LM22 Signature Matrix file and 
confidence scores generated by STRING to first predict the cell type that the gene belongs to. It 
then proceeds to traverse through the network of nodes and compares confidence scores until 
a superceding node is found. This logic is based on the assumption that the input network is an undirected, 
bidirectional graph.
